<LI>reverse-engineering to feed interfaces</LI>

<P>
Naturally, most studies are composed in C (the ANSI-compliant subset), but there are some research crossovers with assembly languages, JavaScript and possibly others.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the only reason this page exists is because of what few web-based, online ports of said C programs were created and uploaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, they require JavaScript to be enabled with support for the <CODE>CANVAS</CODE> element for rendering graphical results to the page from video hardware, thanks to a simple <A HREF="http://cxd4.github.io/OpenGL-js/gl.js">C-style OpenGL ES 1.0 subset wrapper</A> composed specifically for being able to design such ports in smaller, simpler code.
